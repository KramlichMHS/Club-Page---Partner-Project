# Club Page - Partner Project
**Directions**: For this assignment, you and your partner will build a website for a highschool club. Both you and your partner will be using the Replit to create your assignment. Both you and your partner will be able to work on the same set of HTML and CSS files (similar to a google doc!).  

Before you begin, you and your partner will need to develop a site map for your website. You can see an example site map [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1pOh4layENPQE18qxx3PFRUHVcujNkItSR3Lr60Hzfmk/edit?usp=sharing). These site maps can be built out of google drawings. The site map should contain the different pages you plan on building and the contents within them. ***Your site map must be approved by Mr. Kramlich before you begin creating your website!***  

Your club's website should have 3 pages:   
- Home  
- Information  
- Calendar  

Your website must also include the following: 
- an embeded google calendar
- a seprate CSS page for styling
- centered pages for clean look (we will do a demo as a class)
- pictures (these can be stock images from the internet)
- additional information to fill out all three required pages.
